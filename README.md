Enter the command `exit` to quit the game.

Use up and down arrows to navigate through previosly used commands.

In order to go around the world enter the command `map`, which fetches the nearest 20 locations from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). 

```
Pokedex > map

sinnoh-pokemon-league-area
oreburgh-mine-1f
oreburgh-mine-b1f
